| HOW TO CHANGE POKEMON SUMMARY |
|_______________________________|

Summary to replace:
...\pokemmo\data\mods\Mod-Catppuccin-Mocha-x.x\Theme-Catppuccin-Mocha\res\monster-info.png

- Replace monster-info.png with another image from the rejuvenated-cards folder. (...\pokemmo\data\mods\Mod-Catppuccin-Mocha-x.x\Theme-Catppuccin-Mocha\res\rejuvenated-cards)
- Tip: Instead of deleting the previous monster-info.png, you can rename it to eg. monster-info2.png etc. The game will only load the monster-info.png as the pokemon summary and ignore files that are named differently

- Keep in mind that there has to be a monster-info.png inside the res folder, else the Catppuccin theme will crash and the game will use the default theme instead.
