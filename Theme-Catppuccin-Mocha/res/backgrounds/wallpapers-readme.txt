| HOW TO CHANGE LOGIN BACKGROUND |
|________________________________|

Background file to replace:
...\pokemmo\data\mods\Mod-Catppuccin-Mocha-x.x\Theme-Catppuccin-Mocha\res\background.png

- The default background.png is a fully transparent image that shows the default Zekrom animation due to its transparency. 
- Replace background.png with your desired image. Only .png's work (you can easily convert other image formats with image editing programs to .png though). 
- Tip: Instead of deleting the previous background.png, you can rename it to eg. background2.png etc. The game will only load the background.png as its background image and ignore files that are named differently

- Your background.png can have lower resolution than your screen. Your background.png will always get stretched to fit your screen (So keep aspect ratio of background.png close to your monitor's aspect ratio).
- Keep in mind that there has to be a background.png inside the res folder, else the Catppuccin theme will crash and the game will use the default theme instead. 
- So if you want to change back to the default login Zekrom animation, you have to replace background.png back with the transparent png. The transparent png and some sample 4k 16:9 backgrounds can be found in the backgrounds folder.
