| HOW TO CHANGE BATTLE UI BACKGROUND |
|____________________________________|

Battle ui file to replace:
...\pokemmo\data\mods\Mod-Catppuccin-Mocha-x.x\Theme-Catppuccin-Mocha\res\battle-hud.png

- Replace battle-hud.png with another image from the battle-hud-background-customizations folder. (...\pokemmo\data\mods\Mod-Catppuccin-Mocha-x.x\Theme-Catppuccin-Mocha\res\battle-hud-background-customizations)
- Tip: Instead of deleting the previous battle-hud.png, you can rename it to eg. battle-hud2.png etc. The game will only load the battle-hud.png as the battle UI background and ignore files that are named differently

- Keep in mind that there has to be a battle-hud.png inside the res folder, else the Catppuccin theme will crash and the game will use the default theme instead.
