## Who is this repo for?
- People who want to develop their own version of this theme and want to see the changes after updates in a convenient way

## Features
- It is planned that one commit on main branch equals one whole version update. Similar to the way the PokeMMO devs handle it on their github repo
- Each version gets its own github release, where you can download the theme zip file the way is was released at that time. So you can eg. download two different versions and run `diff` commands your own way.
- This repo is meant for archiving purposes, so it is not planned to be used for developing
- You could send issues/pull requests on feature requests. But I'm not sure if I'll answer them and I only want to make changes to this theme that improve things. I don't want to make updates for the sake of updating
- If you have difficulties installing this theme or any other questions, you can DM me on the Pokemmo Forums @ Wusiala
